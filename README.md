    Project name: Security products and reviews.

# Aims and Objectives:
    The aim of this Project is to meet the requirements of the milestone project and try use C.R.U.D to develop a website that 
    will send request from a user and take user input. When it does this it should retrieve data from my MongoDB Atlas database and return 
    to the user the the information they are looking for.
    The user should also be able to appropriatly interact with the user interface and interact with the database through the website accordingly.
    The objective is to provide a positive interaction with the user and allow them to easily interact with the data and learn from the data. It is important to make sure
    that the website is nice visually and that the user can Create, Remove, Update and Delete from the database within reason.
# Prototypes and ideas:

# Technologies used:
Html5,CSS3,Javascript,Jquery,Python3,Heroku,MongoDB Atlas,
Materialize,Gitpod,Github.

# Testing
I constantly tested my code online through running it on heroku and via the gitpod CLI. I kept testing the code and debugging it until I 
corrected the code so that it ran properly and all connections were correct.
# Defensive Programming
