# Title:
    Data centric milestone by Patrick Trollip.
    Project name: Security products and reviews.

#Deployment:
    Link to the website is : https://locks-data-centric.herokuapp.com/

# Aims and Objectives:
    The aim of this Project is to meet the requirements of the milestone project and try use C.R.U.D(Create,Read,Update and Delete) to develop a website that 
    will send requests from a user and take user input so that they can make changes to the database. When it does this it should retrieve data from my MongoDB Atlas database using a GET request and return 
    to the user the the data they are looking for.Likewise the user will be able to use a POST method request to the database that allows the user to send to the database edited data which includes deleting,updating and creating data.
    The user should also be able to appropriatly interact with the user interface and interact with the database through the website accordingly and with ease to envoke positive user interaction and experience.
    The objective is to provide a positive interaction with the user and allow them to find a lock on the market an compare it's security specifications with alternative products so they can make a informed decision on what lock to buy.
    Also users of other locks can add to the database and share their experience in the description of the lock giving it's,brand,general description and the Pros and Cons the lock offers the user based on theior experience.

# Technologies used:
    Html5,CSS3,Javascript,Jquery,Python3,Heroku,MongoDB Atlas,
    Materialize framework,Gitpod,Github.

# Testing:
    I constantly tested my code online through running it on heroku and via the gitpod CLI. I kept testing the code and debugging it until I 
    corrected the code so that it ran properly and all connections were correct.
    When testing I found that sometimes I had to use alternative platforms to test the code when debugging as the website and code would not launch properly. 
    To achieve that I used Codepen and webbased inspect tool to try find the problems.

# Defensive Programming:
    I used git ignore to hide files with passwords and user information.

# Version Control:
    I used Github to save files and updates to the files through regular Git commands like add,commit and push when developing my code.

#Data handling and Database structure:
    I used Mongo Database Atlas with the Flask library in my project to store user data to the database and allow them to manipulate the data from my
    web application.

#User functionality and structure:
    I used a navigation bar for users to navigate from page to page with a common layout across each page.
    I also made sure I was allowing the user to Create data in the data base, Read data, Update or edit the existing data and to allow them functionality to Delete data.

#Attribution and resources:
    Github for deployment.

    Gitpod for building the projct.

    I used tutorials on my coding course to help me in getting the project functionality.

    Used Slack and my tutors at code institute to help address questions about code.
